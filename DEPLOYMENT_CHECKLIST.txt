   □ Make it PUBLIC
   □ Check "Add a README file"
   □ Click "Create repository"

□ STEP 2: UPLOAD WEBSITE FILES

   □ Click "Save"
   □ Note the URL that appears (will be live in 1-2 minutes)

□ STEP 4: CONFIGURE NAMECHEAP DNS
   □ Log into Namecheap.com
   □ Go to "Domain List" → Click "Manage" next to snowsounds.net
   □ Click "Advanced DNS" tab
   □ Delete any existing A or CNAME records for @ and www hosts
   □ Add 4 A Records:
      Type: A Record, Host: @, Value: 185.199.108.153, TTL: Automatic
      Type: A Record, Host: @, Value: 185.199.109.153, TTL: Automatic
      Type: A Record, Host: @, Value: 185.199.110.153, TTL: Automatic
      Type: A Record, Host: @, Value: 185.199.111.153, TTL: Automatic
   □ Add 1 CNAME Record:
      Type: CNAME, Host: www, Value: [yourgithubusername].github.io., TTL: Automatic
      (Replace [yourgithubusername] with your actual GitHub username)
   □ Click green checkmark to save each record

□ STEP 5: CONNECT DOMAIN IN GITHUB
   □ Back in GitHub: Settings → Pages
   □ Under "Custom domain", type: snowsounds.net
   □ Click "Save"
   □ Wait for DNS check (can take 10 minutes)
   □ Once DNS check passes, enable "Enforce HTTPS"

□ STEP 6: WAIT FOR DNS PROPAGATION
   □ Wait 15 minutes to 1 hour (rarely longer)
   □ Visit snowsounds.net in your browser
   □ Refresh if needed

□ STEP 7: CUSTOMIZE YOUR SITE
   □ Open index.html and update:
      □ Your email address (line 34)
      □ Your bio text (lines 24-28)
      □ Your social links (lines 43-47)
   □ Upload updated index.html to GitHub
   □ Wait 1-2 minutes and refresh snowsounds.net

DONE! Your site is live!

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If site shows 404: Wait longer, DNS can take time
- If HTTPS won't enable: DNS may not be fully propagated yet
- If page looks broken: Check that style.css uploaded correctly
- If domain doesn't work but .github.io does: Check Namecheap DNS settings

WHAT TO REMEMBER:
✓ Your GitHub username is important for DNS
✓ The CNAME file tells GitHub your custom domain
✓ Changes take 1-2 minutes to appear
✓ Keep your repository PUBLIC for GitHub Pages to work
